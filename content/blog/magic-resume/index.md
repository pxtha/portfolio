## Project Summary

Magic Resume is a web application designed to simplify the process of creating and managing professional resumes. With a user-friendly interface and a variety of customization options, users can create a professional resume in minutes.

### Key Features

- **Invite member**

- **Easy-to-use interface**
- **Variety of templates**
- **Customization options**
- **Save and manage resumes**
- **Realtime Editing**
- **OpenAI integration**

## Technologies Used

Here's a brief overview of the tech stack that's used to build Reactive Resume.

- React (Vite), as the frontend

- NestJS, as the backend

- PostgreSQL, as the primary database

- Prisma ORM, as the interface between the server and the database

- Redis, mostly for caching, but also used to track resume statistics

- Minio, an open-source S3 alternative to store objects

- Browserless, an open-source docker image that allows to run headless Chrome as a separate service

## Challenges and Learnings

Developing Magic Resume was both challenging and rewarding. One of the main challenges was ensuring that the user interface was intuitive and easy to use. I learned a lot about user experience design and how to create an interface that is user-friendly.

I also gained valuable experience in full-stack development, working with both the frontend and backend of the application.

## Future Plans

I plan to continue improving Magic Resume by adding more templates and features. I also plan to implement user authentication to allow users to save and manage multiple resumes.
