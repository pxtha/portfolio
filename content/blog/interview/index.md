# Interview Preparation

To help you prepare for the interview based on the job description and your feedback on the interview process, I’ll structure a simulated interview with three rounds:
1. Technical Coding Round
2. System Design & Architecture
3. Behavioral & Experience Discussion

Each round will focus on the relevant skills outlined in the job description and align with what you’ve shared about the interview expectations. I’ll also include some potential questions and scenarios based on the interview feedback you provided.

## Round 1: Technical Coding Challenge (45 minutes)

This round focuses on problem-solving, coding proficiency, and algorithmic thinking. You’ll work on a live coding exercise using a codeshare link provided by the interviewer.

### Coding Questions:
1. **K-th Largest Element in an Array**
  - **Prompt**: Given an unsorted array, find the K-th largest element.
  - **Approach**: Mention using a min-heap (binary heap) of size K. Explain why this approach is efficient (O(N log K) complexity).
  - **Follow-up**: Discuss potential edge cases and optimizations.

2. **Two Sum**
  - **Prompt**: Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices of the two numbers that add up to `target`.
  - **Approach**: Start with a hash map solution for O(N) time complexity.

3. **Find Middle of a Linked List**
  - **Prompt**: Given a singly linked list, find its middle node. If the list has an even number of nodes, return the second middle node.
  - **Approach**: Use the two-pointer technique for optimal O(N) time complexity.

### Things to Keep in Mind:
- Aim for the most efficient solution possible without overthinking.
- Communicate concisely: The interviewer prefers seeing a solution rather than hearing an extended explanation unless prompted.
- Manage your time effectively, as they might ask up to 3 coding questions.

## Round 2: System Design & Architecture (60 minutes)

This round evaluates your understanding of system design, scalability, and handling edge cases. It will include high-level design questions and potentially require designing on a virtual whiteboard or document.

### Questions:
1. **Design a Payment System**
  - **Objective**: Design a payment flow that can handle multiple transactions simultaneously.
  - **Considerations**:
    - **Scalability**: How would you handle a high volume of concurrent transactions?
    - **Error Handling**: Implement retries, timeouts, and failure recovery mechanisms.
    - **Security**: Discuss how to secure transactions (e.g., encryption, tokenization).
    - **Logging & Monitoring**: How would you set up alerts and logs for real-time issues?
    - **Tech Stack**: Consider using microservices, queues, and database transactions. Mention using cloud services like AWS for scalability.

2. **Rate Limiter Design**
  - **Objective**: Design a rate-limiting mechanism to prevent abuse of an API.
  - **Data Structures**: You could use a hash map with sliding window counters or a leaky bucket algorithm.
  - **Considerations**:
    - Handling burst traffic and deciding on a rate-limiting strategy.
    - Trade-offs between memory usage and performance.
    - Scaling the solution to a distributed system.

### Tips:
- Focus on outlining the key components of your design first before diving into specifics.
- Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) when explaining your approach.
- Be prepared to discuss trade-offs and why you chose a particular solution.

## Round 3: Behavioral & Experience Interview (30 minutes)

This round focuses on your past experience, problem-solving approaches, and fit within the team culture. Expect questions related to the technologies mentioned in the job description, as well as some general questions about your experience.

### Questions:
**Experience Discussion**:
  - Describe your experience with Golang and building microservices.
  - Can you share a challenging project you worked on that involved PostgreSQL/MySQL?
  - Walk us through a time when you optimized an application’s performance.
  - Share an example of when you had to handle API integration or resolve a tricky bug in production.

**DevOps & CI/CD**:
  - What experience do you have with Docker, Kubernetes, and setting up CI/CD pipelines?
  - How would you ensure that your code is maintainable and scalable?

## Technical Coding Round

### Question 1: K-th Largest Element in an Array

> **Interviewer:** Given an unsorted array, find the K-th largest element.
>
> **You:**
> "To solve this problem, I would use a min-heap of size K. This approach is efficient with a time complexity of O(N log K). Here is a sample implementation in Golang:"

My normal simple solution for this:
1. Sort the array in descending order
2. Get the K-th element from the sorted array. 1st -> index 0, 2nd -> index 1, ..., K-th -> index K-1

#### Need to understand how to calculate the time complexity of the solution.
#### Understand heaps data structure:
- Power of heap:
  - Find the smallest/largest element in O(1) time
  - Insert an element in O(log N) time
  - Remove the smallest/largest element in O(log N) time
  - Search for an element in O(N) time
- Concept of Heap:
  - Tree-based data structure
  - A heap is a complete binary tree
  - Two types of heaps: min-heap and max-heap
    - In a min-heap, the parent node is smaller than its children
    - In a max-heap, the parent node is larger than its children
- Representing a heap:
  - Array-based representation
  - Parent node at index i:
    - Left child at index 2i + 1
    - Right child at index 2i + 2
  - Child node at index i:
    - Parent node at index (i - 1) / 2
    - 
```go
package main

import (
	"container/heap"
	"fmt"
)

func findKthLargest(nums []int, k int) int {
	h := &IntHeap{}
	heap.Init(h)
	for _, num := range nums {
		heap.Push(h, num)
		if h.Len() > k {
			heap.Pop(h)
		}
	}
	return heap.Pop(h).(int)
}

type IntHeap []int

func (h IntHeap) Len() int           { return len(h) }
func (h IntHeap) Less(i, j int) bool { return h[i] < h[j] }
func (h IntHeap) Swap(i, j int)      { h[i], h[j] = h[j], h[i] }
func (h *IntHeap) Push(x interface{}) {
	*h = append(*h, x.(int))
}
func (h *IntHeap) Pop() interface{} {
	old := *h
	n := len(old)
	x := old[n-1]
	*h = old[0 : n-1]
	return x
}

func main() {
	nums := []int{3, 2, 1, 5, 6, 4}
	k := 2
	fmt.Println(findKthLargest(nums, k)) // Output: 5
}
```

### Question 2: Two Sum

> *Interviewer:** Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices of the two numbers that add up to `target`.
>
> **You:**
>"I would use a hash map to solve this problem in O(N) time complexity. Here is a sample implementation in Golang:"

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func twoSum(nums []int, target int) []int {
	m := make(map[int]int)
	for i, num := range nums {
		if j, ok := m[target-num]; ok {
			return []int{j, i}
		}
		m[num] = i
	}
	return nil
}

func main() {
	nums := []int{2, 7, 11, 15}
	target := 9
	fmt.Println(twoSum(nums, target)) // Output: [0, 1]
}
```

### Question 3: Find Middle of a Linked List

> **Interviewer:** Given a singly linked list, find its middle node. If the list has an even number of nodes, return the second middle node.
>
> **You:**
> "I would use the two-pointer technique to solve this problem in O(N) time complexity. Here is a sample implementation in Golang:"

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type ListNode struct {
	Val  int
	Next *ListNode
}

func middleNode(head *ListNode) *ListNode {
	slow, fast := head, head
	for fast != nil && fast.Next != nil {
		slow = slow.Next
		fast = fast.Next.Next
	}
	return slow
}

func main() {
	head := &ListNode{1, &ListNode{2, &ListNode{3, &ListNode{4, &ListNode{5, nil}}}}}
	fmt.Println(middleNode(head).Val) // Output: 3
}
```

## System Design & Architecture

### Question 1: Design a Payment System
