# Journey of Creating ShopTalk AI - Part 2

## Welcome

In this blog series, I will be documenting my journey of creating my first SaaS product, ShopTalk AI. As a developer, I am excited to share my experiences, challenges, and learnings with you. In this first blog post, I will discuss how I am preparing my knowledge to start the project.

# ShopTalk AI

### Vision

Help businesses to increase their sales by providing a personalized shopping experience to their customers.

### Mission

Our mission is to make shopping a joy with our AI chatbot that easily leads customers to their perfect products, making buying a snap. 

We're also passionate about helping Vietnamese businesses tap into the latest technology in a way that's affordable, easy, and quick.

### Culture

Professionalism

### What is does?

ShopTalk AI is an AI chatbot that helps customers find the perfect products for them, making shopping a breeze. For example, if you're going to a wedding, our chatbot will help you find the perfect dress, shoes, and accessories to make you look and feel your best. The chatbot will provide direct links to buy the products, making the buying process quick and easy.

In addition to product recommendations, the chatbot will provide insights on the best deals and discounts available across various platforms. For businesses, the chatbot will offer insights into customer preferences and buying habits to help improve their sales and marketing strategies. The chatbot will support different platforms like Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Zalo, and websites.

### How it works?

Natural Language Processing: Using the ChatGPT API to understand and respond to customer queries.
Data Crawling: Crawling simple data from e-commerce platforms like Shopee to provide real-time product recommendations and deals.
Platform Integration: Supporting multiple platforms to ensure a seamless experience for both customers and businesses.

### How to Take Simple Steps to Creating the First MVP
#### Using ChatGPT API:

Develop a conversation flow to guide customers through product searches and recommendations.
Crawling Simple Data from Shopee:

Set up a web crawler to gather data on products, prices, and deals from Shopee.
Use this data to provide up-to-date recommendations and insights to customers.

#### Building the Chatbot:

Develop the chatbot’s frontend for platforms like Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and websites.
Ensure the backend can handle real-time data processing and integration with the ChatGPT API and data crawler.
#### Testing and Feedback:

Conduct beta testing with a small group of users to gather feedback.
Iterate on the chatbot’s features and performance based on user feedback.
Stay tuned for the next blog post, where I will delve into the technical aspects of integrating the ChatGPT API and setting up the web crawler.
