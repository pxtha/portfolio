# The clean coder

## Introduction

In this blog series, I will be documenting my journey of becoming a clean coder. As a developer, I am excited to share my experiences, challenges, and learnings with you. In this first blog post, I will discuss how I am preparing my knowledge to start the project.

## The story

The idea for becoming a professional coder came to me while I was reading the book Clean Coder by Robert C. Martin. He explains his expectation for a professional programmer on management interactions, time management, pressure, on collaboration, and on the choice of tools to use. The book inspired me to become a better developer 

## Where to start

To begin my journey of becoming a professional coder, these are concept i learned from the book:
## Professionalism 
- Greate power comes with greate responsibility, professionalism is all about taking responsibility.
- How to taking responsibility: 

    - TEST BEFORE SHIP; TEST BEFORE SHIP

        I should have taken responsibility early and told Tom that the tests **weren’t complete** and that I was not prepared to ship the software on time. That would have been hard, and Tom would have been upset. But no customers would have lost data, and no service managers would have called.
        
    - DO NO HARM to the function

        **0 bug**

        Be responsible for your imperfections

        Start with QA find nothing, must know it work 100% (100% test coverage, test all of it, learn Test Driven Development )

        Have automation test

    - DO NOT HARM to structures
        
        Why do most developers fear to make continuous changes to their code? They are afraid they’ll break it! Why are they afraid they’ll break it? Because they don’t have tests.

        If you want your software to be flexible, you have to flex it!

        Merciless refactoring: Every time you read through the code you adjust the structure

    - WORK ETHIC

        Learning is your responsibility, not your employer 

        Professionals spend time caring for their profession

        Those extra 20 hours for learning should be fun!

#### Must Know your field

“Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.”

    - Do you know what a Nassi-Schneiderman chart is?

    - The difference between a Mealy and a Moore state machine

    - Do you know what the term “Transform Analysis” means?

    - Could you perform a functional decomposition with Data Flow Diagrams?

    - What does the term “Tramp Data” mean?

    - Have you heard the term “Conascence”?

    - What is a Parnas Table?

    - Design patterns. You ought to be able to describe all 24 patterns in the GOF book and have a working knowledge of many of the patterns in the POSA books.

    - Design principles. You should know the SOLID principles and have a good understanding of the component principles

    - Methods. You should understand XP, Scrum, Lean, Kanban, Waterfall, Structured Analysis, and Structured Design

    - Disciplines. You should practice TDD, Object-Oriented design, Structured Programming, Continuous Integration, and Pair Programming.

    - Artifacts: You should know how to use: UML, DFDs, Structure Charts, Petri Nets, State Transition Diagrams and Tables, flow charts, and decision tables

#### Continous learning

#### Practice
-  Practice is when you 
specifically exercise your skills outside of the performance of your job for the 
sole purpose of refining and enhancing those skills

#### Collaboration

#### Mentoring

#### Know your domain
- If you are writing an accounting system, 
you should know the accounting field.
- If you are writing a travel application, 
you should know the travel industry.

#### Identify your boss

- It’s easy to fall into an us versus them attitude with your employer. Professionals avoid this at all costs.

#### Humility
- Just Laugh when you can




## Saying No

#### Adversarial Roles

“Do; or do not. There is no trying.” 

Negotiation for the best possible out come, protect your benefit:

Dont just say let me try, 

The conversation was a bit adversarial, and there were a few uncomfortable moments, but that’s to be expected when two people assertively pursue goals that aren’t in perfect alignment

#### High Stake

The most important time to say no is when the stakes are highest. The higher 
the stakes, the more valuable no becomes

        Don: “There’s nothing I can do Chuck. We’ve been through this already. 
        Galitron won’t cut scope, and they won’t accept any interim 
        releases. They want to do the installation once and be done with 
        it. I simply cannot do that any faster. It’s not going to happen.”

        Charles: “Damn. I don’t suppose it would matter if I told you your job 
        was at stake.”

        Don: “Firing me isn’t going to change the estimate, Charles.”

        Charles: “We’re done here. Go back to your team and keep this project 
        moving. I’ve got some very tough phone calls to make.”

#### Being a "team player"

A team-player communicates frequently, keeps an eye out for his or her teammates, and executes his or her own responsibilities as well as possible

A team player is not someone who says yes all the time.

Defend the team, know what could, and could not, dont just just lied through teeth to just being good in somebody eyes. 

#### TRYING

THERE IS NO TRYING, JUST DO OR NOT

#### Passive aggression

When a freight train is bearing down on you and you are the only one who can 
see it, you can either step quietly off the track and watch everyone else get run 
over, or you can yell “Train! Get off the track!”

Record evidents in every convo, direct to the one have higher power, be professional and polite.

#### The cost of saying Yes

“Is good code impossible? Is professionalism impossible?”

Answer: I say no.


## Saying Yes

#### Language of commitment

Say. Mean. Do.

Lack of commitment:

-  “We need to get this done.” “I need to lose weight.” “Someone 
should make that happen.”
- “I hope to get this done by tomorrow.” “I hope we can meet 
again some day.” “I wish I had time for that.” “I wish this computer was 
faster.”
- “Let’s meet sometime.” “Let’s finish this thing.”

Commitment:

- I will .... by < time >

    You’re stating a fact about something YOU will do with a clear end time

    You’re taking full responsibility for something, in front of an audience of at least one person. 

    I will read the book everyday and finish by 15/6 

But you can commit to specific actions that will bring you to your target.

If the end goal depends on someone else, you should commit to specific actions that bring you closer to the end goal.

If you can’t make your commitment, the most important thing is to raise a red flag as soon as possible to whoever you committed to. I there always another plan to able to commit to

If you don’t tell anyone about the potential problem as soon as possible, you’re not giving anyone a chance to help you follow through on your commitment.

#### Learning how to say YES

- use maybe if uncertain
- ALWAYS commit with discpline: 

    He might be able to get 
done faster if he doesn’t write his tests. He might be able to get done faster if he 
doesn’t refactor. He might be able to get done faster if he doesn’t run the full 
regression suite --> NO, NEVER, 

As a professional, has already made a commitment to maintain these standards.

```
Peter: “OK, Marge, I’ll tell you what. I’ll call home and clear some overtime with my family. If they are OK with it, then I’ll get this task done by Monday morning. I’ll even come in on Monday 
morning to make sure everything goes smoothly with Willy. But then I’ll go home and won’t be back until Wednesday. Deal?”
```

Saying yes but clear of the effort, cost


#### Conclusion
Professionals are not required to say yes to everything that is asked of them. 
However, they should work hard to find creative ways to make “yes” possible. 
When professionals say yes, they use the language of commitment so that there 
is no doubt about what they’ve promised.
