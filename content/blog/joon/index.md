## Technologies Used

This project utilizes a variety of technologies to deliver a robust and scalable solution:

### Front-end:
- **ReactJS**: Used for building the dashboard and web interfaces, ReactJS allows us to build complex user interfaces from isolated pieces of code called "components".
- **Flutter**: Used for mobile application development. It's a UI toolkit that allows us to natively compile applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

### Back-end:
- **Golang**: The backend service is written in Golang, which provides excellent performance and simplicity.
- **Python**: For the AI auto verification profiles and recommendation system.

### Database:
- **PostgreSQL**: This is our primary relational database, known for its reliability and robustness.
- **Redis**: Used as an in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker.
- **Dgraph**: Used for providing recommendation systems, leveraging its graph database capabilities.

### Others:
- **Asynq**: This is our message queue of choice, providing reliable asynchronous task processing.
- **Prometheus**: Used for event monitoring and alerting.
- **Loki**: Integrated with Prometheus, Loki is used for centralized logging.
- **Kuma-Uptime**: Used for monitoring the uptime of our services.
- **Kubernetes (k8s)**: Used for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
